# Hello World

I'm not very good with staying consistent with writing or blogging, so I'm hoping that this exercise will help me stay consistent.

I'm Amal Afroz Alam. I'm a biomedical engineer turned software engineer turned to founder turned to product manager.

Along the way, I've kept up with new technologies and enjoyed seeing what people have built and imagined what could be built.

So with this blog I want to start documenting my personal journey of re-learning to code, starting with the very basics of HTML and CSS.

Thank you for reading, hope to see you again soon. :)
